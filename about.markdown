### Hi I'm Chloe.

email: chloechia at berkeley dot edu

I like working on projects in software, vision and perception. I'm starting my 4th year at UC Berkeley soon, but am taking a gap semester interning at NVIDIA in Santa Clara.

On campus, I'm involved with Machine Learning @ Berkeley, and worked on projects in the research committee! This includes compute access improvements, organizing reading groups, and most importantly designing our hoodie.

### summers spent at:

Anduril (SWE)
