### Hi I'm Chloe

email: chloechia at berkeley dot edu

I like working on projects in software, vision and perception. I'm starting my 4th year at UC Berkeley soon, but am taking a gap semester interning at NVIDIA in Santa Clara.

On campus, I'm involved with Machine Learning @ Berkeley, and worked on projects in the research committee! This includes improving compute access, organizing reading groups, and most importantly designing our hoodie.

### previous summers:

summer 24: Intrinsic (SWE)

summer 22: Culdesac (Growth)
