### Hi I'm Chloe

email: chloechia at berkeley dot edu

I'm starting my 4th year at UC Berkeley soon, but am taking a gap semester interning at the NVIDIA GPU team in Santa Clara.

On campus, I'm involved with Machine Learning @ Berkeley, and worked on projects in the research committee! This includes improving compute access, organizing reading groups, and most importantly designing our hoodie :)
