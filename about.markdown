Hi I'm Chloe.
email: chloechia at berkeley dot edu

I like working on rewarding projects. I am starting my 4th year at UC Berkeley soon, but am taking a gap semester senior fall to spend time interning at NVIDIA.
On campus, I'm involved with Machine Learning @ Berkeley, and worked on projects in the research committee.
