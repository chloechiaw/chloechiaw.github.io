# May 23rd:

- Rust is a very opinionated programming language! As a newbie, I feel like I need to understand the Rust philosophy of approaching memory without garbage collector/fighting borrow checker in order to actually get it. To me, Rust philosophy is like: “worry about this now, compile time will be slow” but “runtime will be super fast”.
- Box::new(5), pointer that allocates memory on the heap for an integer, 5.
- Detail in error messages matches the error complexity! Rust compiler is nice (e.g. if you use a variable that has been moved).

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Box::new(5);

    let mut y = x; // mutable reference to x.

    *y = 4;

    assert_eq!(*y, 4);

    println!("Success!");
}

error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `x`
 --> src/main.rs:9:5
  |
3 |     let x = Box::new(5);
  |         - move occurs because `x` has type `Box<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
4 |
5 |     let mut y = x; // mutable reference to x.
  |                 - value moved here
...
9 |     assert_eq!(*x, 4);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ value borrowed here after move
  |
  = note: this error originates in the macro `assert_eq` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
help: consider cloning the value if the performance cost is acceptable
  |
5 |     let mut y = x.clone(); // mutable reference to x.

- string literals (&s aka string slice) vs. String types (String::from("hello world") using a string literal, stored as vector of bytes) are a thing!
- .tostring() converts a string literal to a String type 
```
- &mut vs ref: &mut is used to create a mutable reference while ref is used to create a reference in destructuring (for example, a tuple)

```rust 
fn main() {
    let t = (String::from("hello"), String::from("world"));

    // Using ref to borrow the elements of the tuple
    let (ref s1, ref s2) = t;

    // Now s1 and s2 are references to the elements of t
    println!("{}, {}", s1, s2); // Output: "hello", "world"
```
